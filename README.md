# Bedload-GUI

Hi Team,

I decided to create a github channel to consolidate updates and ensure that everyone is using the same version.  I am using python V3.7 with spyder.  The spyder version you have shouldn't impact the functionality of the code also feel free to use another program to run the GUI.
