# Bedload-GUI

Hi Team,

I decided to create a github channel to consolidate updates and ensure that everyone is using the same version.  I am using python V3.7 with spyder.  The spyder version you have shouldn't impact the functionality of the code also feel free to use another program to run the GUI. From the main page of the repository, you can click the green button that says 'code' and download a zipped file containing everything you need.
